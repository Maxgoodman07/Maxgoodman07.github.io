title: ECE Discovery Project 
description: <u><h3>Discovery Project Idea</h3></u><br>The idea for my discovery project came from the YJSP
  Club at Georgia Tech. As part of their onboarding project, all new members in the avionics subteam had 
  to design a custom PCB that met certain parameters. One of those parameters was the power requirement,
  which is what I based my Discovery Project around.
skills: 
  - drumel
  - microprobing
  - Electronics Teardown
  - PCB analysis
  - audio system design

## Project Progress
The project progressed well throughout the semester. PCB design was an entirely new concept to me, and it
took much longer than expected to make much progress at all with the design. While the original plans for
the progression of this project were much more ambitious than what actually happened in reality, I would
say the goal behind this project was achieved.

## Project Successes and Failures
### Successes
The biggest success that came from this project was the ability to get the designed PCB to pass the
simulations ran in LTspice. This demonstrated that the actual design was beginning to work. While it is
hard to say whether a PCB will actually perform or not until it is actually deployed, this is a big step
in the right direction.

### Failures
The largest failure encountered was not being able to accomplish everything outlined in the original project
proposition. This project was supposed to be able to be utilised by YJSP by the end of the semester for use
in their rockets, but this turned out to be too ambitious a task for a complete beginner to accomplish in
between balancing classes and other clubs.

Beyond this, there were smaller failures that were encountered and had to be overcome throughout the
development of this design. This includes having to work with components that didn't all properly connect to
one another, and once I got all of the components outlined in a schematic, some of the pieces did not have
associated models that could easily be ran in the simulator.

## ECE Skills Gained
Beyond gaining a better understanding of how PCBs work and how a PCB goes from idea to implementation, I also
learned how to use important, industry-standard software. Specifically, this project taught me how to better
use Altium Designer and LTspice.
