title: ECE Discovery Project 
description: <h2>Discovery Project Idea</h2><br><br>The idea for my discovery project came from the YJSP
  Club at Georgia Tech. As part of their onboarding project, all new members in the avionics subteam had 
  to design a custom PCB that met certain parameters. One of those parameters was the power requirement,
  which is what I based my Discovery Project around.
skills: 
  - drumel
  - microprobing
  - Electronics Teardown
  - PCB analysis
  - audio system design
